Usage="Usage:  ${cmd} [dvips options] filename[.dvi]
  Prints a TeX dvi file in 2-up format (i.e., rotated, 2 columns per page).
  As with dvips, the output is spooled directly to the printer by default.
  See the dvips man page for dvips options.
 
  There is now a much better way of producing 2-up output.
  See \"news 2up.tex\" for more information.  --Craig."
