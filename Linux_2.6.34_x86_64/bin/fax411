# 411 - Access phone book as a database (after Kernighan and Pike)
# Usage: 411 pattern
# Note: ignoring case in searches
# A feature (or bug) is that 411 sans args prints the whole phonebook.
# Jack K. Cohen, 1985
# Modified 7 Jan 1992 by John Stockwell
#    to include a search of a user-defined phonebook: $HOME/lib/phonebook
