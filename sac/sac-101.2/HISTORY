	      - line termination does not handle all type of line termination
	      - merge command broken
	      - time shrinks on plots with large number of records

2007/11/20 Version 101.1
	* Supported Platforms: Solaris, Linux (32/64 bit), Mac OS X
	  ( PPC and i686, <= 10.4 ), and Windows under Cygwin.
	  - Compilation on 64 bit systems (Linux) requires specific options 
	    to the ./configure script to create a 32 bit version on a 64 bit 
	    platform.  Please consult the Readme.buildsac for details.  
	  - OSX/i686 builds are not successful using gcc 3 (10.4 and below)
	  - OSX/PPC builds are successful using gcc 3 or gcc 4. (10.4 and 
	    below).
	       If one wants to use the sacio library with Fortran calls,
	       one may need to compile those Fortran programs using gcc 3.
	       See Readme for details.
	  - OSX 10.5 is not supported at this time.
	  - Build are reported to work on OSX 10.2, but required compilation
	    on that platform.
	  - Linux builds are successful using gcc3 or gcc 4, but builds on
	    CentOS 5 will not work on machines running CentOS 4.
          - Windows versions are available under the Cygwin Environment and 
	    must be compiled by each user due to licensing restrictions.
	    There is a separate source distribution for Cygwin (because aux
	    cannot be used as a directory name in Windows).
	* Changed Build System to ./configure / autotools method
	  This should provide a more robust way to create and install SAC
	* Updated: sgftox.csh change postscript viewer to ghostscript
	* Addition of libsacio.a, same file as sacio.a.  Changed to
	  ease compilation.
	* Added wsac3: same as wsac0, but writes out all current header 
	  vaiables.  However, on the Mac PPC platform, there are 
	  compatibility problems with gcc and g77.  See Readme for details.
	  Added wsac3 description to  aux/help/user_man/10appendix.
	* BUG FIX: Sort command now works with the SeisMgr database off
	* BUG FIX: Parsing of polezero files now works for lengthy
	  character strings.
	* BUG Fix: Parsing of multiple blackboard variables fixed
	* BUG FIX: Large Crosshairs work again
	  Enable by defining the environment variable 
	  SAC_PPK_LARGE_CROSSHAIRS to 1
	* ENHANCEMENT: Zoom within PPK now does not care about pick order
	* BUG FIX: o changed to odelta to avoid a conflict
	* BUG FIX: isNaN() unsuitable for double, changed to system
	  command isnan().  Found while checking polezero constants.
	* ENHANCEMENT: DEPRECATED Function added
	* ENHANCEMENT: Suppress Copyright notice Option Added
	  SAC_DISPLAY_COPYRIGHT

	* To Do:
	   - Build and Testing
	      Testing suite

	   - Known Bugs
	      Files that begin with a long integer
              Line termination while parsing files
	      No error output on "ch o gmt" truncation, better error 
	      reporting
	      r pha*? multiple times gives segmentation fault
	      Missing SAC> when run in a script
	      Error should in in stderr not stdout
	      "WARNING: Number 4003 integer too large" 
	      wsac1 and wsac2 do not update all header variables
	      "do .. wild" loop bombs if total number of characters  
                  for filenames too large

           - Plotting Bugs
	      Time shrinks on plots with lots of records
	      Reformat Plotting Window

	   - General Code Cleanups
	      Merge files that overlap, better merge code
	      remove code repetition, hdr.h, extfuncs.h, and  SacHeader.h
	      Use of common blocks, global variables
	      rolllback command does not work

	   - Additional Functionality
	      Scalability, 1000 files, more, no limit ?
	      write with a format 
	         e.g. "write %kzdate.%kztime.%kstnm.%knetwk.% kcmpnm.sac"
	      get/set functionality
	      	       includes initialization file
		       and setting "set lh.columns 2"
	      make sgftops independent of endian used when writing .sgf file

2007/03/03 Version 101.0
	* Supported Platforms: Solaris, Linux (32 bit), and Mac OS X 
	  (both OSX/PPC and OSX/i686).  On OSX/i686, a build does not
	  work using gcc 3.  On OSX/PPC, builds are successful with either
	  gcc 3 and gcc 4 for OS 10.4 and gcc 3 for 10.3.  A successful build
	  is reported on OS 10.2, but builds on 10.4 will not run on 10.2.
	  Builds on Solaris 2.9 will work on 2.8.  On Linux, successful 
	  builds on either gcc 3 or gcc 4.  Sac is not supported on 64-bit
	  architectures, but successful builds on 64-bit machines are 
	  reported using the -m32 flag with gcc plus other modifications.
	* Added ~/utils with sources and makefile for sacswap, saclst,
	  and sgftops.  Executables are included in ~/bin.

		   If environment variable is undefined or set to 1
	           % setenv SAC_USE_DATABASE 1
		Do Not Use Database
		  If environment variable is set to 0
	           % setenv SAC_USE_DATABASE 0
	* Variable: SAC_DISPLAY_COPYRIGHT
