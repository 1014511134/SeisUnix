* Greetings
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Colleagues, 

Thank you for your interest in SAC.  I hope you find SAC and associated
utilities useful and appreciate any constructive  suggestions, criticism, or
contribution of macros and related codes.    

It would also be very helpful if you could acknowledge our work using
the  following reference, 

Goldstein, P., D. Dodge, M. Firpo, Lee Minner (2003) "SAC2000: Signal
processing and analysis tools for seismologists and engineers, Invited
contribution to "The IASPEI International Handbook of Earthquake and
Engineering Seismology", Edited by WHK Lee, H. Kanamori, P.C. Jennings, and
C. Kisslinger, Academic Press, London.  

The rest of this message explains how use the enclosed distribution.   For
additional information about SAC/SAC2000, see our Web page at URL

* Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------
This README file is in the top directory (named sac) of a directory tree
that has either been installed from a sac source distribution or
produced by the expansion of a SAC binary-distribution .tar.gz file.
There are SAC binary-distribution .tar.gz files for three operating systems:

1. Sun Solaris: built on Solaris 2.9, but should run on 2.8 or 2.10.

2. Mac OS X: Universal binary distribution built on i686 (Intel) OS
10.4.11 but should run on OS 10.4 PPC or either i686 or PPC on 10.5.2
or later.

3. Linux: built on CentOS 4.5 (Final). 

Optimization was not used in any of these builds.

Because of licensing issues, there is no Cygwin binary distribution.

For more information on supported operating systems, see HISTORY and
CHANGES in this directory.

It is assumed you have X windows on your system.

The fact that you are reading this README indicates that the SAC distribution
has been installed on your system and you are in the top directory, typically
/usr/local/sac/.

* Package contents

* Environment Setup
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system has to be able to find the binaries and scripts that are in
sac/bin, and the environmental variable SACAUX must be set to sac/aux. In
addition, there are options within SAC that can be set through environmental
variables: e.g., the size of the crosshairs in ppk.  In sac/bin there are
scripts that contain lines to do all these: sacinit.csh (csh and tcsh) and
sacinit.sh (bash).  If the distribution on your computer was built from
sources, these scripts were created during the installation of the SAC
package, so they should have the correct path for the distribution already in
them.  However, if yours is a binary distribution, you may need to edit the
directory for SACHOME. See the script for your shell for descriptions of the
options and the syntax for the commands.  After editing, the script for your
shell can be run as a preliminary to running sac. 

For csh and tcsh edit and then run:
    source sac/bin/sacinit.csh

For Bash edit and then run:
    . sac/bin/sacinit.sh

After you are satisfied with the settings, it is suggested you put the lines
from your shell's script into your .cshrc or .bashrc so that this
initialization does not have to be done every time you run sac.  There is no
system-wide initialization file, so each user must set up his/her own
environment settings.

Here are sample lines that a user would add to his/her start-up file.  
(Here the SAC directory tree starts at /usr/local/sac/.):

For csh and tcsh use:  .cshrc
    setenv SACHOME /usr/local/sac
    setenv PATH ${PATH}:${SACHOME}/bin
    setenv SACAUX ${SACHOME}/aux
    setenv SAC_USE_DATABASE 0
    setenv SAC_PPK_LARGE_CROSSHAIRS 1

For Bash use:  .bashrc
    export SACHOME=/usr/local/sac
    export PATH=${PATH}:${SACHOME}/bin
    export SACAUX=${SACHOME}/aux
    export SAC_USE_DATABASE=0
    export SAC_PPK_LARGE_CROSSHAIRS=1

(On a Cigwin distribution, the aux direcotry is called winaux.  The sacinit
files have winaux instead of aux on a Cygwin distribution.)

It is recommended that you set the above environments in your .login,
.tcshrc, or .cshrc file so they get set each time you log in.

It is recommended that you create an initialization macro that runs whenever
you start SAC.  To do this create a startup macro file (e.g.,
/usr/local/macros/init.m) and alias sac as follows: 

      alias sac '${SACHOME}/sac /usr/local/macros/init.m'

Here is a sample initialization macro:

   lh columns 2 files none; qdp 10000 ; xdiv power off ; xlabel 'Seconds'
   setmacro /usr/local/macros ; transcript history file ./.sachist

For the meaning of these entries (lh, qdp, xdiv, xlabel, setmacro,
transcript), use the help feature in sac.  For further discussion of the
transcript command and command-line editing, see README_utils in directory
utils. 

* Matlab Interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Solaris
  Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include matlab shared object libraries:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/matlab/extern/lib/sol2 
- Mac OS X   
  The DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be set
  setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH 
         ${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/Applications/MATLAB74/bin/maci 
    
  These path may differ on your machine. The path needs to include
   - The Matlab Engine Library (libeng)
   - The Matlab Executable Library (libmex)
   
* If you need help ...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Use the online help from within sac
2.  Some features of SAC are described in the CHANGES file in this directory,
    and changes in new versions are summarized in HISTORY.
3.  URL <http://www.iris.edu/manuals/sac/> has links to other resources and
    information about updates.
4.  A place to share problems and find solutions is the sac-help mailing 
    list: <sac-help@iris.washington.edu>.  For further information, go to
    URL <http://www.iris.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/sac-help>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you are ready to run the executable enclosed with the 
distribution.    We hope you enjoy using sac.

DO NOT DISTRIBUTE the SAC Software.  (That is what you agreed to when
you accepted the license agreement.)
