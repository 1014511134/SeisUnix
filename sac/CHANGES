Please see the History file for list of official release and 
the differences between them.

2008/09/01 George Helffrich <george@gly.bris.ac.uk>
        * Modified TRANSCRIPT command (several files) to include a
	  transcript history file option that enhances the command-line
	  history feature introduced by Brian Savage on August 6. 
	  The help file aux/help/transcript has been updated to include
	  this option.  See utils/README_utils for further information.
	
2008/09/01 George Helffrich <george@gly.bris.ac.uk>
        * Modified src/dfm/xlh.z so that one can have lh columns 2 the
	  default in an init command, by including LH COLUMNS 2 FILES NONE
	  aux/help/listhdr is changed to reflect this new option
	  
2008/09/01 Kuang He <icrazy@gmail.com>
        * utils/sacswap:  Use long swaps for data to avoid signaling
          NaN bit changes with floating point arithmetic.
	  
2008-08-29 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        *  Put in missing equation in aux/help/envelope (user suggestion)
	*  Added README files to directories utils and lib
	
2008-08-19 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        *  Bug Fix: Conversion from text to integer (src/ucf/cnvati.c)
           Global Error Flag set but never reset and is used in
           the evaluate command, src/exm/xeval.c.  Reset Global Error Flag
           at the beginning of each command in src/top/saccommands.c

2008-08-18 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        *  utils/unvis: Utility added to reclaim .sac_history files
        *  bin/sac-config: More documentation added
        *  Version: Updated to 101.2

2008-08-11 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        *  Added Documentation directory for examples using libsac and libsacio
           Will include future updates of the Users Manual and Other 
           Documentation in various formats, including the 
           Sac Command Reference

2008-08-08 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        *  Updated src/evalresp to evalresp 3.2.40 (released July 2008) 

2008-08-06 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Added sac history file (${HOME}/.sac_histroy) to save history
          from session to session

2008-07-10 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
	* Bug Fix: CPU overload fixed for scripts that do not end with quit

2008-07-08 Xiaoning (David) Yang <email@redacted.org>
	* New Contributed Matlab routines to read and write sac files
	  - utils/readsac.m
	  - utils/writesac.m
	  - utils/padcat.m
	  - utils/getsacdata.m

2008-07-08 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Removed confusing lines in src/icm/transfer.c regarding
          uninitialized calib and calper, which are derived from
          wfdisc databases.  Final value of the scaling is printed
          at the end of the transfer routine.
          For Reference
          - calib - Conversion factor that maps digital data to 
                    value with a unit (displacement, velocity, ...)
          - calper - Period at which the calib (-ration) value is 
                     valid.
          - sac files derived from seed files and use polezero files
             and/or response file do not use the calib/calper values

2008-07-05 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
	* Initial creation of the library libsac including the routines
	   - xapiir (filtering)
	   - envelope 
        * Added rsach to only read the sac header
	* Bug Fix in SUDS reading and writing system
	  Byte swapping will only occur if the host is a 
	  Big Endian system.  

2008-05-22 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Added readcor (Read Correlation Funtion) in SPE subprocess
          Currently there is no way to differentiate an actual
          Correlation function file from a regular SAC file

2008-05-13 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        * Fixed cnvfta() handling of very large numbers incorrectly.
          Numbers are now converted to strings correctly and sanely.

2008-04-08  Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Fixed warnings during compiliation by adding missing header files 
          and incorrectly typed parameters in function calls.  Fixed compile 
          warnings were determined from a (1) routine and (2) optimized 
          compile of the full source files.
        * Removed src/sss/xtraveltime SPARC executable file that was not
          removed years ago.
        * Transitioned build system to use inc/config.h.in and inc/config.h
          to hold the configure dependent parameters to clean up the compiler 
          output.

2008-04-01  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * Updated Matlab routines and now is only available if requested
          by the user upon compiliation. Use the value of --enable-matlab
          with the approproiate Matlab installation directory when 
          compiling to include Matlab.  SAC needs to know where to find
          the Matlab libraries when running, use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to add
          the path to the mx and eng libraries.  OS X users may need to
          use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead.  The interaction of Matlab and
          SAC is under development and in serious need to attention, 
          care and help.

2008-03-24  Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Heaily modified the map command, New Options added
          Reworked command to use GMT 4.0 (src/fks/xgmtmap.c,
          aux/help/map)
        * changed a function that is able to determin if SAC is
          run from a script like <<EOF or is run "normally."
          (src/co/select.c)

2008-03-05  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * Fixed segmentation fault bug while reading files with 
          wildcards (src/dfm/readfl.c) .  

2008-03-04  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * Fixed bug in src/scm/xinterpolate.c.  Interpolation of very 
          long time sequences introduced unexpected phase shifts into
          resulting records.  Repeated addition changed to multiplication
          to determine the correct time position of individual samples.

2008-02-18  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * Fixed bug in src/bbs/getbbv.c.  An array was overrunning its
          This caused a segmentation error for the command SAC > map.

2008/02/16 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        * Patched src/gd3.x11/error3.c so it would not crash when
          reporting an error code reported by Xlib.

2008-02-06 Savage, Hellfrich, Snoke:
        * restFP and saveFP only seem to appear on the Apple version of
          the system libraries (libgcc.a) and only for the PPC.  Tests
          found this to be a problem when building Fortran programs on
          the PPC if sac had been built with the -O2 flag.  There are
          work-arounds, but best not to build sac with -O2.  This will
          be followed for future binaries.

2007-11-19  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * Updated Version Number to 101.1
        * Updated sgftox.csh to use ghostscript as the Postscript viewer
        * Readme.buildsac: Added instructions for new configure system
        * Readme: Updated Readme to handle configure 
          script and sacinit.[sh,csh]
        * Makefile.am: Added link between libsacio.a and sacio.a
        * src/dff/wsac3.c: Added, same to wsac0() but now
          updates the depmin,depmax,depmen, and the distance and azimuth.
        * libsacio.a: Changed name from sacio.a but old file still exists
          for backwards compatibility.  
        * Added routines distaz() and extrma() to handle header updates 
          for wsac3().
        * bin/sacinit.[sh,csh]: Initialization scripts for paths
          and Environment Variables
        * src/exm/xabout.c (xabout): 
        * Updated version string to incorporate the Version number
          from the configure scripts (PACKAGE_NUMBER)

2007-10-27  Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Updated Build system to configure/autoconf

2007-10-04  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * SAC/src/dfm/xsort.c (xsort): 
        * SAC/src/dfm/xsort.c (reorder):        
        Fixed the sort command to operate independently of
        the SeisMgr Database routines.  This is important
        as the default is now SAC_USE_DATABASE = 0 or
        "Do not Use the SeisMgr Database"

2007-10-03  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * SAC/src/icm/polezero.c (polezero): 
          Bug Fix:  Characters past the end of variable key 
          were being accessed producing unanticiapted results.
          Changed static length of key to dynamic and modified 
          the calls involving key: strcmp() to strncmp() with
          the inclusion of #defines for each Key Value for a
          PoleZero file.  Documentation of the Function Updated
          for doxygen.

2007-09-28  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * SAC/src/gd3.x11/dispatcheve3.c (dispatchevent3): 
          Added Option to restore Ultra Large Crosshairs on the PPK window
          Environment Variable: SAC_PPK_LARGE_CROSSHAIRS
             0 or Undefined - Tiny Cross Hairs
             1              - Cross Hairs of the Full Plot Window

2007-09-26  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * SAC/src/gam/xppk.c (xppk): 
          From Richard Godbee Through Arthur Snoke
          Make it so the ppk command does not care about the order of 
          picking the lower and upper bounds of the new time window.

        * SAC/utils/sac.h (SacHeaderName): 
          Changed first o the odelta, avoiding a conflict

2007-09-25  Brian Savage  <savage@uri.edu>
        * SAC/inc/proto.h: 
        * SAC/inc/isnan.h: 
          added include "isnan.h" header file for systems lacking isnan()
        * SAC/src/icm/polezero.c (polezero): 
          Changed isNaN() to isnan() as isNaN only operated on single 
          precision floating point numbers.  
        * free(s1) statements were moved so not to get a seg fault
          during an error message
        * SAC/src/dff/f2c.c (DEPRECATED):
          Added function to easily report removed functions and which to use 
          instead
        * SAC/src/dfm/sort.c (isNaN):
          ERROR 2118: No Transfer Function applied. In src/icm/polezero.c
          On reading of the CONSTANT Key from a Pole Zero file
          If the constant is larger than a float from a double can handle
          it barfs on the isNaN() routine in src/dfm/xsort.c
          Since the constant being read into is a double (const_)
          it should call a function with a double argument not a float
          Fix: Use isnan() (in Math Library) instead of isNaN() 
          as it handles both floats and doubles
          FIX: Replaced all occurances of isNAN() with isnan() and
          add a statement in isNaN() about this function being deprecated.
        * SAC/src/exm/xabout.c (xabout):
          Updated exm/xabout.c 
                Uses SAC_DISPLAY_COPYRIGHT
                = 1     Display Copyright
                = 0     Do Not Display Copyright
                = undef Display Copyright
                
2007/03/07 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu> (for Doug Neuhauser 
                                <doug@seismo.berkeley.edu>)                     
        *  src/SeisMgr/cssListOps/cssArchitecture.c 
           The filename array used for determining the architecture of the
           computer is not long enough.  The constructed filename will
           overwrite the end of the array, and cause a segmentation 
           violation.  Increased the size of the array from 31 to 64
        *  src/icm/makefile and src/SeisMgr/makefile:  In both makefiles,
           replaced "make" with ${MAKE}.  Without that, on Sun Solaris,
           trying to use "gmake" would not work for all makefiles.

2007/03/03 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        *  Updated src/evalresp to evalresp 3.2.37 (released October 2006) 

20007/02/23 Brian Savage <savage@uri.edu>
        * Major Bug Fix for all SACIO Library routines.  Filenames and 
          string handling should be much saner now
          (added sac/dff/f2c.c - converts fortran strings to C string)
                Note this is not related to the old f2c program 
                     SAC/src/bbs/getbbv.c
                     SAC/src/bbs/readbbf.c
                     SAC/src/bbs/setbbv.c
                     SAC/src/bbs/unsetbbv.c
                     SAC/src/bbs/writebbf.c
                     SAC/src/co/zopen.c
                     SAC/src/dff/f2c.c
                     SAC/src/dff/getfhv.c
                     SAC/src/dff/getihv.c
                     SAC/src/dff/getkhv.c
                     SAC/src/dff/getlhv.c
                     SAC/src/dff/getnhv.c
                     SAC/src/dff/setfhv.c
                     SAC/src/dff/setihv.c
                     SAC/src/dff/setkhv.c
                     SAC/src/dff/setlhv.c
                     SAC/src/dff/setnhv.c
                     SAC/src/dff/wsac0.c
        * Changed determination of Byte Order in CSS Files
          now done internally versus using a temporary file
        * Added a SAC_USE_DATABASE environment variable
          If set to 0, will not use the database
          If not defined, will use the database
          If set to 1, will use the database
          The database is confusing, and is buggy
          This will dramatically speed up the reading of large file lists
          ( src/ssi/sacToSeisMgr.c)
        * Added a SAC_DISPLAY_COPYRIGHT environment variable
          If defined will not show the COPYRIGHT
          The addition of this code snippet is debatable
          (src/exm/xabout.c)

2006/08/21 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Added SAC/libedit/config.h.in.  This file with the associated 
          makefile removed the dependency on issetugid() so that a build
          on solaris 2.9 would work on solaris 2.8
        * Changed SAC/libedit/makefile.  This removes the dependency 
          on issetugid() and GNU install
        * Changed SAC/src/makefile.  This removes the dependency on 
          GNU install and OS X Darwin now only  depends on 
          libncurses.5.dylib.  Previously, a build on 10.4 would not work
          on 10.3.)

2006/08/18 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        *  Modified bin/sgftoeps.csh so it does not need epstool.  It still
           needs gs.  Also, changed the default scale to 0.75 so that when
           printing the .eps file it does not truncate.
        *  Added a script bin/sgf2x.csh that displays a .sgf file on the
           screen.  It uses gv.  If not available, tries /usr/bin/ggv.
           When running programs over the Internet, gv can be very slow, so
           replacing the call to gv with one to gs can be significantly faster
           This script has the functionality of the old sac program sgfplot.

2006/07/26 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        *  ./src/co/math.c defines fmin, fmax, and labs that are defined 
           in the Standard C library everywhere bu on the Sun. They
           have the same arguments and actions.  On OS X one gets
           warnings about possible redefinitions of these functions
           whenever one compiles a program using sacio.a on Mac OS X.
           Put in a conditional not to define them in math.c on OS X.

2006/07/17 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Bug fix: Make certain a power of 2 is greater than input number
          (src/ucf/next2.c)
        * Bug fix: Memory Leak, Old Files released on a read call
          (src/dfm/readfl.c)

2006/07/01 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        *  Updated several files in aux/help taking out obsolete references.
        
2006/05/31 Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        * added a rm \tmp/sactemp.ps commend in src/gam/xprint.c to erase
          that file after printing so if subsequent user does a p1 print
          there Will not be an existing file with a different owner in /tmp.

2006/05/18 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Added utility program saclst (modified from program by Lupei Zhu).
          Standalone program allows display of header variables that can
          be ported to programs or printed.  Source is in ./utils and is put
          in ./bin during a normal build.

2006/05/04 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Modified the number of Y Limit points to match the 
          maximum number of files
          (inc/gam.h)
        * Added -p flag to install to preserve modification dates
          (src/makefile)

2006/05/02 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        * Edited src/co/math.c so that if fmin and fmax are defined elssewhere
          on the system, they won't be defined again (a warning message)
          Arthur Snoke <snoke@vt.edu>
        * Edited src/makefile so that SAC/utils and SAC/bin/sacswap 
          get copied to PREFIX/sac

2006/03/27 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        * Changed all occurrences of gets() to fgets()and corrected
          boundingbox in sgftops.c (utils/sgftops.c)
        
2006/03/02 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Added utils/sacswap.c and changed Makefile to create it

2006/02/14 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Fixed writehdr bug for files of opposite endian
          (src/dff/wrsac.c)
        * Changed call to map_hdr_out() to allow for swapping
          (src/dff/map_hdr_out.c)
        * Fixed bug in zwabs() with bad prototype
          (src/co/zwabs.c)

2005/12/13 George Helffrich http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~george/gh.html
        * Tweak makefile (again) so builds work on any MacOS system
          (src/makefile)

2005/12/01 George Helffrich http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~george/gh.html
        * Tweak makefile so MacOS 10.2.x builds work
          (src/makefile)
        * Update Readme info to mention 10.2.x builds work
          (Readme.buildsac)

2005/11/30 George Helffrich http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~george/gh.html
        * Eliminate warning messages about redefined #defines by shrouding
          them in #ifdef conditionals.
          (inc/proto.h)

2005/07/22 Richard Godbee <rwg@vt.edu>
        * In Apple OS 10.4.2 with xcode 2.1, swab() is defined twice: 
          in string.h and unistd.h.  As string.h is not needed,
          remove unneeded #include <string.h> from exm/xcd.c.
        * In order to get a successful build using gcc 4.0 in OS 10.4.2,
          found it necessary to move the prototype for e_decompress() 
          above the enlarge() function in SeisMgr/cssListOps/enlarge.c.
          
2005/07/21 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Fixed bug in help command for non-existent commands
          (ucf/wrhelp.c)
        * Fixed pause/redraw bug 
          (co/zgtmsg.c)
        * Added co/select.c to remove duplicate code in co/zgpmsg.c
          and co/zgtmsg.c.  To set a prompt and get a message use
          select_loop() and its axillary functions.
        * Modified co/zsleep.c to be platform independent
          now uses select_loop with a timeout to handle sleeping

        * Updated Makefile for better install process

2005/05/23 Brian Savage <savage13@dtm.ciw.edu>
        * Changed from GNU Readline to editline due to License conflicts
           between GNU Public License and the SAC License
        * Changed function name parse_line to parse_line_evresp
           It conflicts with a function call in the libedit library
          (evalresp/evresp.c)
          (evalresp/string_fctns.c)
        * Fix Bug for X Error Handling and Editline

        * Fix Bug during window resize, now frees and recreates backing pixmap 
          (gd3.x11/dispatcheve3.c)
        * Changed bounding box back to letter (792 612)
          (utils/sgftops.c)

        * USE_X11_DOUBLE_BUFFER was part of the ANNOYANCE_FIXES patch
	   Moved the position of where the XExposeEvent is emitted from the
	   end of the command loop to endframe->endframe3->flushbuffer so now
	   only  routines that draw to the screen get an XExposeEvent.  
           Many of the files
           are changing the #ifdef Statements from ANNOYANCE_FIXES to 
           USE_X11_DOUBLE_BUFFER

        * USE_X11_MULTIPLE_DEPTHS allows use of XCreateImage and XPutImage
           on displays of various depths.  We need to know what the pixel 
           size when creating an XImage, which depends on the depth of 
           the window and display.

        * Updated sgf plotting utilities to with enhanced versions from 
           Arthur Snoke.  New version of sgftops does translation rotation 
           and scaling  of postscript plots. sgftoeps.csh is a csh shell 
           script that creates encapsulated postscript  that are compatible 
           with latex and version 10 of Adobe Illustrator. The script 
           requires epstool (http://www.ghostgum.com.au/) and ghostscript 
           (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/).

        * Added export to SACFLAGS to push -D$(OSTPYE) into subdirectories
        * Added OSTYPE=linux for linux systems defined as linux-gnu
        * Command Line editing added to main/sac.c
           Uses the GNU Readline Library
           Set ANNOYANCE_FIXES=TRUE in makefile to get comnnad line editing
        * Updated X11 events for window redraws (gd3.x11)
           We now draw to a pixmap when ploting and this is then drawn to the 
           screen. When one window overlaps the plotting window, the pixmap 
           is drawn to the screen
           Set ANNOYANCE_FIXES=TRUE in makefile to get X11 Fixes
        * Added a select() call to switch between X Events and Keyboard Events
        * Modified csserror.c to not use sys_errlist and sys_nerr, they output 
           warnings upon linking/compilation

        * Version 100.00 released for Solaris, Linux, and OS X
        * Recent enhancements and bug fixes: 
        * Automatic byteswapping has been implemented.  SAC will automatically 
           read sac data files in either big or little endian format. (ie., It 
           doesn't matter if your data were created on a little endian 
           platform like i686-based PCs or big endian platforms like 
           Sun workstations.   
        * readalpha/readtable (command for reading ascii tables or columns of 
           xy data): a bug in the linux version has been fixed.
