The contents are compressed tarfiles of CWP codes that
are proprietary to the Consortium Project on Seismic Inverse
Methods for Complex Structures.

These codes may be extracted via the UNIX command:

zcat filename.tar.Z | tar -xvf -

Each tarfile will produce a directory of the name 'filename'
in the user's current working directory.


The codes depend on the CWP/SU Free software package available
via anonymous ftp from  ftp.cwp.mines.edu (138.67.12.4).
The pertinent directory path is pub/cwpcodes. The files you
will need are README_BEFORE_UNTARRING,
untar_me_first.xx.tar.Z, and cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z where xx is the number
of the current release. If you do not have ftp access, please
contact the CWP office at (303) 273-3557 and we will send you the
free distribution on a floppy diskette.

The file U-NUMBERS gives an explanation of each code.

If you have questions about any of the codes please contact:
