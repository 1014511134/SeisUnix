--- to be used with the public domain package 'pvm' from Oak Ridge.


To get free software from Oak Ridge, just email to 

	netlib@ornl.gov.

In your message simply say

	send pvm_tar from pvm

to get the source code for pvm. You may have to put several pieces
together.  You can also get the index of the whole network library
by saying

	send index

The most important difference between the distribution PVM and that
used by CWP is that the PVM daemon (pvmd) is assumed to be in the
directory /usr/local/cwp/bin/ on every host, instead of in /tmp/pvm/.
The location of the daemon is specified in the file ./dist/pvmd.h.

The CWP interface to PVM (written by Dave Hale) is defined in the files 
pvm.h and pvmcwp.c.

The file pvm.h and an example Makefile are 
located in the directory  ./cwpinclude

The file pvmcwp.c and an example Makefile are 
located in the directory  ./cwplib
