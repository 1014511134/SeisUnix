SUDOC - List the Full Online Documentation of any Item in SU</A>
</H1>
As has been alluded to in previous sections of this manual, there
is a database of selfdocumentation items that is available for each
main program, shell script, and library function.
This database exists in the directory $CWPROOT/src/doc  and is
composed of all of the selfdocumentation paragraphs of all of the
items in SU.

<P>
Because not all all items with selfdocs are executable, an additional
mechanism is necessary to see the selfdoc for these items.
For example, information about the Abel transform routines, located in
$CWPROOT/src/cwp/lib/abel.c (on the system at CWP,
 CWPROOT=/usr/local/cwp) is obtained via

<P>
<PRE>
% sudoc abel

In /usr/local/cwp/src/cwp/lib: 
ABEL - Functions to compute the discrete ABEL transform:

abelalloc	allocate and return a pointer to an Abel transformer
abelfree 	free an Abel transformer
abel		compute the Abel transform

Function prototypes:
void *abelalloc (int n);
void abelfree (void *at);
void abel (void *at, float f[], float g[]);

Input:
ns		number of samples in the data to be transformed
f[]		array of floats, the function being transformed

Output:
at		pointer to Abel transformer returned by abelalloc(int n)
g[]		array of floats, the transformed data returned by 
		abel(*at,f[],g[])

Notes:
The Abel transform is defined by:

	         Infinity
	g(y) = 2 Integral dx f(x)/sqrt(1-(y/x)^2)
		   |y|

Linear interpolation is used to define the continuous function f(x)
corresponding to the samples in f[].  The first sample f[0] corresponds
to f(x=0) and the sampling interval is assumed to be 1.  Therefore, the
input samples correspond to 0 &lt;= x &lt;= n-1.  Samples of f(x) for x &gt; n-1
are assumed to be zero.  These conventions imply that 

	g[0] = f[0] + 2*f[1] + 2*f[2] + ... + 2*f[n-1]

 Notes: This program produces a muiltifilter (as opposed to moving window)
 representation of the instantaneous amplitude of seismic data in the   
 time-frequency domain. (With Gaussian filters, moving window and multi-
 filter analysis can be shown to be equivalent.)                        
                                                                        
 An input trace is passed through a collection of Gaussian filters      
 to produce a collection of traces, each representing a discrete frequency
 range in the input data. For each of these narrow bandwidth traces, a 
 quadrature trace is computed via the Hilbert transform. Treating the narrow
 bandwidth trace and its quadrature trace as the real and imaginary parts
 of a "complex" trace permits the "instantaneous" amplitude of each
 narrow bandwidth trace to be compute. The output is thus a representation
 of instantaneous amplitude as a function of time and frequency.        
                                                                        
 Some experimentation with the "band" parameter may necessary to produce
 the desired time-frequency resolution. A good rule of thumb is to run 
 sugabor with the default value for band and view the image. If band is
 too big, then the t-f plot will consist of stripes parallel to the frequency
 axis. Conversely, if band is too small, then the stripes will be parallel
 to the time axis.                                                      
                                                                        
 Examples:                                                              
    suvibro | sugabor | suximage                                        
    suvibro | sugabor | suxmovie n1= n2= n3=                            
     (because suxmovie scales it's amplitudes off of the first panel,  
     may have to experiment with the wclip and bclip parameters

 Algorithm:

 This programs takes an input seismic trace and passes it
 through a collection of truncated Gaussian filters in the frequency
 domain.

 The bandwidth of each filter is given by the parameter "band". The
 decay of these filters is given by "alpha", and the number of filters
 is given by nfilt = (fmax - fmin)/band. The result, upon inverse
 Fourier transforming, is that nfilt traces are created, with each
 trace representing a different frequency band in the original data.

 For each of the resulting bandlimited traces, a quadrature (i.e. pi/2
 phase shifted) trace is computed via the Hilbert transform. The 
 bandlimited trace constitutes a "complex trace", with the bandlimited
 trace being the "real part" and the quadrature trace being the 
 "imaginary part".  The instantaneous amplitude of each bandlimited
 trace is then computed by computing the modulus of each complex trace.
 (See Taner, Koehler, and Sheriff, 1979, for a discussion of complex
 trace analysis.

 The final output for a given input trace is a map of instantaneous
 amplitude as a function of time and frequency.

 This is not a wavelet transform, but rather a redundant frame
 representation.

There is more information in the <B>sudoc</B> listing,
than in the selfdoc listing. The selfdoc is intended as a quick reference,
whereas the sudoc listing can provide additional information
that we do not necessarily want to see everytime we are, say, simply wanting
to know what a particular parameter means, for example.
