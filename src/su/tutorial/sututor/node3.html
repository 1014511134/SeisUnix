Acknowledgments</A>
</H1>

<P>
The Seismic Unix project is partially funded by the Society of 
Exploration Geophysicists (SEG), and by the Center for Wave Phenomena (CWP), 
Department of Geophysical Engineering, Colorado School of Mines.  Past 
support for SU has included these groups, as well as the Gas Research
Institute (GRI).

<P>
Thank you SEG, and CWP for your continued support!

<P>
The sponsors of the CWP Consortium Project have long been partners
in the  SU project and we are pleased to explicitly acknowledge that
relationship here.  In addition, we wish to acknowledge extra support
supplied in the past by IBM Corporation and by the Center for
Geoscience Computing at the Colorado School of Mines during the
late 1980's when SU was ported to the modern workstation from its
previous incarnation on graphics terminals.

<P>
So many faculty and students, both at our Center and elsewhere, have
contributed to SU, that it is impossible to list them all here.
However, certain people have made such important contributions that they
deserve explicit mention.

<P>
Einar Kjartansson began writing what is now called SU
(the SY package) in the late 1970's while still a graduate student
at Jon Claerbout's Stanford Exploration Project (SEP). He continued 
to expand the package while he was a professor at the University of 
Utah in the early eighties.  In 1984, during an extended visit to SEP
Einar introduced SY to Shuki Ronen, then a graduate student at Stanford.
Ronen further developed SY from 1984 to 1986.   Other students at SEP
started to use it and contributed code and ideas.  SY was inspired by much
other software developed at SEP and benefited from the foundations laid by
Clairbout and many of his students; Rob Clayton, Stew Levin, Dave Hale, Jeff
Thorson, Chuck Sword, and others who pioneered seismic processing on Unix
in the seventies and early eighties.  

<P>
In 1986, Shuki Ronen brought this work to our Center during a
one year postdoctoral appointment at the Colorado School of Mines. 
During this time, Ronen aided Cohen in turning SU into a 
supportable and exportable product.

<P>
Chris Liner, while a student at the Center, contributed to many of the graphics
codes used in the pre-workstation (i.e, graphics terminal) age of  SU.
Liner's broad knowledge of seismology and seismic processing enabled
him to make a positive and continuing influence on the SU coding
philosophy.

<P>
Craig Artley, now at Golden Geophysical, made major contributions to
the graphics codes while a student at CWP and continues to make
significant contributions to the general package.

<P>
Dave Hale wrote several of the ``heavy duty'' processing codes as well
as most of the core scientific and graphics libraries.  His knowledge
of good C-language coding practice helped make our package an excellent
example for applied computer scientists.

<P>
Ken Larner contributed many user interface ideas based on his
extensive knowledge of seismic processing in the ``real world.''

<P>
John Scales showed how to use  SU effectively in the classroom in his
electronic text, Theory of Seismic Imaging, Samizdat Press, 1994.
This text is available from the Samizdat press site at:  samizdat.mines.edu.

<P>
John Stockwell's involvment with SU began in 1989. He is largely 
responsible for designing the Makefile structure that makes the 
package easy to install on the majority of Unix platforms.  He has 
been the main contact for the project since the first public release 
of SU in September of 1992 (Release 17).  After
Jack Cohen's death in 1996, Stockwell assumed the role of principal
investigator of the SU project and has remained in this capacity to
the present.   The number of codes has more than tripled in the 11
years, since John Stockwell has been PI of the project.

<P>
The project has also has had extensive technical help from the
worldwide SU user community.
Among those who should be singled out for mention are Tony Kocurko at
Memorial University in Newfoundland, Toralf Foerster of the 
Baltic Sea Research Institute in Warnemuende Germany, Stewart A. Levin, John
Anderson, and Joe Oravetz at Mobil Oil, Joe Dellinger at Amoco, Matthew
Rutty, Jens Hartmann, Alexander Koek, Michelle Miller
of the University of Southern California at Chico,
Berend Scheffers, and Guy Drijkoningen, Delft,
Dominique Rousset, Pau and Marc Schaming, Strasbourg,
Matt Lamont, Curtin University, Australia, 
Wenying Cai at the University of Utah, Brian Macy of Phillips Petroleum,
Robert Krueger of Terrasys, Torsten Shoenfelder of the University
of Koeln, Germany, Ian Kay of the Geological Survey of Canada,
Dr. Toshiki Watanabe of the University of Kyoto, and independent
consultant Reg Beardsley.
Our apologies in advance for undoubtedly omitting mention 
of other deserving contributors to
 SU--we promise to include you in future updates of this manual!

<P>
We especially thank Barbara McLenon for her detailed suggestions on the text
and also for her excellent design of this document, as well as the
SU pamphlets, and other materials, which we distribute at public meetings.
