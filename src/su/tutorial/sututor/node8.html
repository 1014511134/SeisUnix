What SU is not</A>
</H1>

<P>
The SU package is not a graphical user interface driven utility
at this time, though there are several possibilities including Java
and TCL/TK scripts, which may be exploited for this purpose in the future.
Because most commercial seismic processing packages are GUI-based,
it is unavoidable that users will expect SU to be similar to these
packages.
However, this is not a fair comparison, for several reasons. 

<P>
As mentioned above, SU is an extension of the Unix operating system.
Just as there are no GUI driven Unix operating systems that give full
access to all of the capabilities of Unix from menus, it is not 
reasonable to expect full access to Seismic Unix through such an 
interface.   At most, any SU interface will give limited access
to the capabilities of the package.

<P>
SU is not a replacement for commercial seismic packages. Commercial
seismic software packages are industrial-strength utilities designed
for the express purpose of production-level seismic processing.
If you do commercial-level processing, and have dedicated, or plan
to dedicate funds to purchase one or more license of such commercial
software, then it is unlikely that you will be able to substitute
SU for the commercial utility.

<P>
However, SU can be an important adjunct to any commercial package
you use. Where commercial packages are used for 
production work, SU often has found a place as a prototyping package. 
Also, if new code needs to be written, SU can provide a starting base
for new software applications.
Indeed, the availability of seismic processing capability may encourage
non-processors to experiment with processing, non-software-developers
to experiment with software development, and non-researchers to 
engage in research.

<P>
SU is not confined to seismic applications. It may find use, both
in geophysical and more general signal processing applications. It certainly
can be useful for teaching students about ``wave related'' signal
processing and, particularly, Fourier transform properties.
This can include radar, non-seismic acoustics, and image processing,
just to name a few.

<P>
Another thing that SU is not, at least in its current version,
is a 3D package. However, it is not, expressly a 2D package, either,
as there are numerous filtering and trace manipulation tasks that
are the same in 2D as in 3D. It is likely, however, that there will
be 3D applications in future releases of SU. A single 3D migration
code appeared first in Release&nbsp;32, which will hopefully set the
stage for new developments.
