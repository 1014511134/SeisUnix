Notes
-----
This example plots the model and quits.

(1) The file model describes the model here.  Notice that you have
to provide a description of the upper surface now as well.
Also, an interface description is terminated by a large
negative z coordinate (-99999. for example).

(2) You are given control, to some extent, of the colors
in the plot (more control to come in the future).  The colors
are specified in file colors here. (You might find that not all
the colors are working as advertised, ie, as specified by the key.)

(3) To get a plot of the model enter m (or M) in record 3.
To plot the model and then quit, as is done here, enter mq.
